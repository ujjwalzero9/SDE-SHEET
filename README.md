### 🎯 How to Use This Repository

1. **Start with Basics**: Begin with the "Arrays" section, and solve each problem. Gradually move to more complex topics like **Dynamic Programming** and **Graphs**.
2. **Practice and Understand**: Try solving problems on your own first. If you get stuck, look at the solution and understand the approach.
3. **Track Your Progress**: Use the sections to keep track of the problems you've solved. Revisit difficult problems later for revision.
4. **Apply Concepts**: Try to apply learned concepts in real-world scenarios or build small projects.

### 🔥 Example of Problem and Solution

#### Problem: **Maximum Product Subarray**
- **Given an integer array**, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.
- **Example**:  
  Input: `[2, 3, -2, 4]`  
  Output: `6`  
  (The subarray `[2, 3]` has the largest product.)
